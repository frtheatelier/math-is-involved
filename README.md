# math-is-involved
A compilation of simple math-based apps to play around with. <br>
They are written in Python and mostly for practice on my end.

### Games
> The games are runnable at the Python console (run `main.py` on any folder)
- [Equations](equations): answer as many math questions in a row! Complexity of equations sort of increase in difficulty the more you score.
- [Stacks](stacks): answer as many questions as you'd like (kind of like Equations, only that you don't have to do them in a row). Do take note of your answers though, they're important! (Hint: game title suggests what you might have to do)
